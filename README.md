# PokemonApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.4 and uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

To use this application on your own machine, simply clone the repo. After navigating to the 'pokemon-app' folder, run `npm install` to install all necessary node modules. 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Click the name of any Pokemon on the list to be redirected to a page that displays an image of the chosen Pokemon, along with stats and moves of the Pokemon.

I am currently working on deploying this project to GitHub Pages so that it can be interacted with on the web, as well as adding styling via SCSS, a search function, and ability to expand the list beyond the 20 Pokemon that the Pokemon API serves by default.
